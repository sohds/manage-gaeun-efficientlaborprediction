# manage-gaeun-efficientlaborprediction
The project started in September 2022 in the 'Data Science Capstone Design' class and is currently is in progress @ AM.SWU.
The school's alumni association organizes the cafe, and this project will figure out how the alumni association can manage part-timers efficiently in time allocation.
